# Rails Homework: Validations

I found this homework easier so for that reason I'm feeling more confident with Rails.

* I found it much easier to make the Users resource manually than I would have done  yesterday!

* I didn't find it too hard to make validations

* I found it easy to check my database using the Rails console.
